# ft_turing

First project made in OCaml at school 42 with [eliottdhommee](https://github.com/eliottdhommee)

## Description (from subject)
The goal of this project is to write a program able to simulate a single headed,
single tape Turing machine from a machine description provided in json.
This project is to be written in functionnal. OCaml is a solution, but any
functionnal language is allowed. If you use another langage, make sure you
respect the functionnal paradigm. It will be a good occasion to experiment
clever type designs and a smart functionnal approach to your program. This
will be checked during evaluation
As stated below, you will be free to use any libraries you like. The project
is also a good opportunity to discover famous and widely used libraries like
Core or Batteries to name a few.
